## Introduction
Welcome to Command Line Flashcards. As I was working my way through Command Line Crash Course, one part was to memorize command line prompts. I used react to quickly create simple web application to memorize command line prompts

## Motivation
I began the Command Line Crash Course to learn command line. I started out with physical flashcards to memorize command line prompts. When they started to wear out I decided to create a flashcard web application. 

## Built With
- React
- CSS
